You want a simple mobile app to track worker attendance and email a weekly Excel report.\n\nHere's a plan for the first version:\n\n- **Attendance Input Screen:** A screen where you can input worker names and mark their attendance for each day of the week. This could use a table-like layout.\n- **Weekly Report:** Generate a summary of the week's attendance.\n- **Email Integration:** A button to send the weekly report as an Excel file to eddy.rxwl@hotmail.com. Note: Sending emails directly from the app might require a backend service.\n\nFor the design, let's consider:\n\n- **Colors:** A base color of white or light gray, a primary text color of dark gray or black, and accent colors of blue or green for interactive elements.\n- **Typography:** Use a modern, clean font like \"System\" or \"Roboto\" for readability.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-09-24T23:57:19.535363"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a simple attendance tracking app with weekly reports that can be emailed as Excel files.
